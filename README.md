<Portfolio-Challenge>

## Description 

 Portfolio-Challenge is the second challenge for the Ohio State coding bootcamp. Unlike the first challenge there was no starter code povided. 
-	My motivation for this project was to become proficient at coding HTML, and CSS by creating a basic portfolio.  
-	Building this project allowed me to implement coding techniques that I have been studying for the past two weeks. 
-	This page was a perfect example of real-world practices and solved the problem of assignments with no starter code to begin with. 
-	I learned how to code and deploy a simle webpage with nothing more than HTML, CSS, and a few images.
